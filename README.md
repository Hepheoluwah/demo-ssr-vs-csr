# Server vs Client User List Demo

This project demonstrates the difference between **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** in a React/Next.js application. It includes two user lists: one loaded by the server instantly, and another loaded in the browser using JavaScript.

---

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
  - HTML is generated on the server before sending to the browser.
  - Content appears instantly.
  - Works even if JavaScript is disabled.
  - Shows server timestamp to demonstrate instant loading.

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**  
  - HTML is minimal at first; data is fetched in the browser using JavaScript.
  - Shows a slight loading delay before content appears.
  - More interactive UI, easier to build dynamic interfaces.

- **Refresh Button**  
  - Allows you to reload both lists and see updated data.

- **SSR vs CSR Cards**  
  - Visual explanation of the differences between SSR and CSR with benefits listed.
